I'm a first-year Engineering Science student at University of Toronto.

I started programming at the beginning of Grade 11. At that time, I was still exploring potential areas that I was interested in and trying to set goals for myself.
But after I wrote my first program and saw the computer display what I had coded, I became very intrigued by the area of Computer Science and decided to explore many different areas of CS across clubs/teams and projects.

Here's a timeline of my journey so far:
- Sep 2022 - Jan 2023: Coded for the first time as part of the Grade 11 Intro to CS course (ICS3U), developing two simple Java TicTacToe and Connect 4 games. Joined my high school's FTC Robotics team as the lead programmer for the team's junior team (19447), developing encoder autonomous movement and driver-controlled code (won FTC Control Award).
- Mar 2023 - Jun 2023: Developed a JavaFX password application for the Elderly as part of my Grade 11 Chem CPT project (submission to YRSTF fair).
- Sep 2023 - Feb 2024: Remained in my high school's FTC Robotics team as the lead programmer for the team's senior team (19446), developing autonomous movement with PID encoders, dead wheels odometry using RoadRunner library, and training custom object detection models with OpenCV.
- Sep 2023 - Jun 2024: Joined my high school's App Development Team as a Backend Developer, developing notification functionalities for the school app.
- Oct 2023 - Nov 2023: Developed Honami Ichinose Bot, a Discord Bot that has Spotify and Task Management functionalities to help with study.
- Dec 2023 - Apr 2024: Joined my high school's Computer Science Club as a Teaching Executive, helping with activities and CCC preparation.
- Feb 2024 - Jun 2024: Took Grade 12 CS Course, where I developed a socket-networked Mortal Kombat game, which is the largest game development focused project that I have ever worked on.
- Aug 2024: Began my journey in ML/AI, taking Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization.
- Sep 2024: Developed my first ML project, OtakuNet, a content-based recommender system to recommend animes based on the user's liked genres with a neural network framework made from scratch.

I always like to learn new things as I continue this coding journey in the future!
