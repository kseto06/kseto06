I'm Kaden, a 2nd year [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/) student at University of Toronto passionate about machine learning and AI, with a focus in reinforcement learning. Currently, I'm serving as VP Academics at University of Toronto's Machine Intelligence Team (UTMIST), [UofT's largest undergraduate machine learning team](https://utmist.ca), leading the organization of UTMIST's academic workshops, events, and programs.

Previously, I interned at BMO as a Software Developer in Summer 2025. In first year, I was a Reinforcement Learning Team Lead in UTMIST, where I led the development of [UTMIST's first-ever tournament](https://utmist.ca/ai2) and subsequently produced a [technical paper](AI_Squared___CUCAI_2025_Paper_final.pdf), submitted to CUCAI. I also led the Application Review Committee of GenAI Genesis 2025, Canada's largest AI hackathon.

In high school, I served as the Lead Programmer for my [high school's Robotics Team](https://titansrobotics.odoo.com/) and as a Backend Developer for my [high school's App Development Team](https://app.staugustinechs.ca/).
