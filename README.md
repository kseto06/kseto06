I'm Kaden, a 2nd year [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/) student at University of Toronto passionate about machine learning and AI, with a focus in reinforcement learning. Currently, I'm serving as **VP Academics** in University of Toronto's Machine Intelligence Student Team (UTMIST), [UofT's largest undergraduate machine learning team](https://utmist.ca), leading the organization of UTMIST's academic workshops, events, and programs.

Previously, I interned at **BMO** as a **Software Developer** in Summer 2025. In first year, I was a **Reinforcement Learning Team Lead** in UTMIST, where I led the development of [UTMIST's first-ever tournament](https://utmist.ca/ai2) and subsequently produced a [technical paper](https://cucai.ca/2025_proceedings.pdf#page=28), submitted to CUCAI. I also led the **Application Review Committee** of [GenAI Genesis 2025](https://genaigenesis.ca/), Canada's largest AI hackathon.

In high school, I served as the **Lead Programmer** for my [high school's Robotics Team](https://titansrobotics.odoo.com/) and as a **Backend Developer** for my [high school's App Development Team](https://app.staugustinechs.ca/).
